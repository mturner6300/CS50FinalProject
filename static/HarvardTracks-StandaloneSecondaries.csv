Celtic Languages and Literatures,https://handbook.fas.harvard.edu/book/celtic-languages-and-literatures,"Students who complete a Secondary Field in Celtic may expect, not only to become familiar with the origins of the Celtic peoples and the growth of their cultural traditions, but also to understand better the foundations of ethnicity in any people that understands itself as possessing a distinct identity; to develop a keen critical awareness of the nature and vitality of oral traditions in their vibrant interrelationships with literary traditions; and to be aware of the precarious state of many of the world’s seven thousand languages, and why it matters. "
Educational Studies,https://handbook.fas.harvard.edu/book/educational-studies,"The Educational Studies secondary field offers students an opportunity to examine education from multiple disciplinary perspectives. Education is an intentional intervention in human development. For as long as we know, human beings have been interested in how to shape children into adults who understand cultural values and can contribute to the needs of the community. In modern societies, education is seen as a prime lever for a number of key (and sometimes conflicting) goals, such as increasing national economic competitiveness, supporting upward mobility, improving public health, increasing civic engagement and achieving global understanding. In addition, defining features of contemporary life, such as the proliferation of digital technologies and global migration, have significant implications for education. As a result, questions about education are central to number of academic disciplines, including psychology, sociology, economics and government. The Education Studies Secondary leverages this multidisciplinary interest in education and allows students to create a coherent program of study from courses offered across the University. "
Energy and Environment,https://handbook.fas.harvard.edu/book/energy-and-environment,"Students from a wide range of concentrations, including the humanities, are invited to participate in the program to explore how different disciplinary perspectives on energy and environment intersect and inform one another. For example, a student concentrating in English may wish to increase their knowledge of the environment and energy in the context of environmental literature or history. A student studying global health may want to better understand the impacts of climate change on water resources, nutrition, and human health. Or, a student in the physical sciences may want to expand their training by improving their understanding of climate dynamics and energy production to support their interest in materials science and energy storage. All participating students share exposure to the core issues related to climate change, the consequences of energy choices, and changes in our physical and biological environment, preparing them to make informed professional and personal decisions about some of the most pressing societal challenges of the 21st century.

"Ethnicity, Migration, Rights",https://handbook.fas.harvard.edu/book/ethnicity-migration-rights,"The secondary field in Ethnicity, Migration, Rights (EMR, formerly Ethnic Studies) offers students an opportunity to pursue sustained, interdisciplinary study of ethnicity, migration, indigeneity, and human rights, with special attention to Asian American and Pacific Islander, Latinx, Muslim American, and Native American studies. Courses in EMR are taught by faculty from humanities and social science disciplines across the FAS and other Harvard schools. "
"European History, Politics, and Societies",https://handbook.fas.harvard.edu/secondary-fields/book/european-politics-and-societies,"This interdisciplinary structure allows for multiple paths of research and specialization, and accommodates a variety of approaches in a study of Europe. The Secondary Field is based at the Minda de Gunzburg Center for European Studies (CES), the locus of innovative research on European history and contemporary affairs. As members of the EHPS cohort, students also are integrated into CES programming such as the Lectures, Conferences and Seminar series, the Europe in Washington Workshop, the CES Student Society, etc. "
Global Health and Health Policy,https://handbook.fas.harvard.edu/book/global-health-and-health-policy,"A secondary field in Global Health and Health Policy (GHHP) could explore any of these topics within the United States or across the world, moving into such themes as: accountability and governance – the role of the state versus transnational organizations and corporations in global health; the relevance and morality of global socioeconomic inequality in health; the risk of pandemic diseases and their economic and psychological impact on populations; the consequences of political change in a country's health; and the challenges resulting from complex emergencies and vulnerable populations in fragile states. "
Medieval Studies,https://handbook.fas.harvard.edu/book/medieval-studies,"The secondary field in Medieval Studies examines the Middle Ages from many different angles and through the eyes of many different disciplines. It draws on the wealth of medieval teaching and scholarship at Harvard, where there are faculty medievalists in at least twenty departments, programs, and schools. The secondary field consists of one foundational course in any discipline, plus four more advanced courses that expose students to the wide range of disciplines that make up Medieval Studies. While some of these courses teach or require specialist skills, most are intended to be accessible to any interested student, whatever the student's field of specialization. "
Microbial Sciences,https://handbook.fas.harvard.edu/book/microbial-sciences,"Microbial sciences is an interdisciplinary approach to studying the impact of microbes at scales from global ecosystems down to single-celled microenvironments. The academic program emphasizes the joint study of species diversity, metabolic function, geochemical impact, and medical and pharmaceutical applications of microbial sciences. Faculty affiliated with the Microbial Sciences Initiative (MSI) include members from Molecular and Cellular Biology, Organismic and Evolutionary Biology, Earth and Planetary Sciences, Chemistry and Chemical Biology, the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences, Harvard Medical School, Harvard School of Public Health, and the Forsyth Institute. "
"Mind, Brain, Behavior",https://handbook.fas.harvard.edu/book/mindbrainbehavior,"Mind Brain Behavior (MBB) introduces students to the interdisciplinary study of the mind, the brain, and behavior. As a secondary field, it offers students the opportunity to confront the significant findings that have arisen from the traditional disciplines in the MBB area of inquiry and emphasizes the intellectual innovations that stem from crossing traditional disciplinary lines. Students will learn how past and current researchers have brought the perspectives of neuroscience into dialogue with those of other natural sciences, the social sciences, and the humanities, and will develop habits of interdisciplinary thinking themselves. In particular, the secondary field provides opportunities to learn about computational, neurobiological, evolutionary, psychological, linguistic, philosophical, and historical approaches and their interactions."
"Regional Studies: Russia, Eastern Europe, and Central Asia",https://handbook.fas.harvard.edu/book/russia-eastern-europe-and-central-asia,"The secondary field in Regional Studies: Russia, Eastern Europe, and Central Asia (REECA) offers students the opportunity to pursue interdisciplinary work on the history and society of this world region. The field requirements are based on the premise that when studying society and culture, the integration of various academic disciplines allows insights unobtainable within the confines of a single discipline. While the field may integrate the study of language, literature, and culture, the primary emphasis here is on the social sciences, including history. "
Translation Studies,https://handbook.fas.harvard.edu/book/translation-studies,"The secondary field in Translation Studies offers students the opportunity to undertake a sustained study of the theory and practice of translation. More than simply examining how meaning is transferred from one language to another, translation studies opens up a space to examine linguistic encounter and exchange across languages, as well as across multiple cultures and disciplines.  Students who pursue a secondary field in Translation Studies will root their translation work within language study, but they will be able to expand their engagement with the art and craft of translation to encompass questions raised by different genres, media, and disciplinary questions and practices.
