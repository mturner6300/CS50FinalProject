Applied Mathematics,https://handbook.fas.harvard.edu/book/applied-mathematics,"The Applied Mathematics concentration consists of a broad undergraduate education in the mathematical sciences, especially in those subjects that have proved vital to an understanding of problems arising in other disciplines, and in some specific area where mathematical methods have been substantively applied. For concentrators, a core learning objective is building and demonstrating foundational knowledge in computation, probability, discrete, and continuous mathematics through the successful completion of the foundation and breadth courses. In addition, through their coursework, concentrators should gain facility and comfort in using approximation to simplify problems and gain insight. They should learn to communicate effectively with fellow technical professionals, and should be prepared, by their senior year, to tackle mathematical modeling problems in their area of application, at the level of a senior thesis. Additionally, students can expect to be able to attain employment or, with appropriate planning, gain admission to graduate study in applied mathematics."
Biomedical Engineering,https://handbook.fas.harvard.edu/book/biomedical-engineering,"Biomedical Engineering lies at the intersection of the physical and life sciences, incorporating principles from physics and chemistry to understand the operation of living systems. As in other engineering fields, the approach is highly quantitative: mathematical analysis and modeling are used to capture the function of systems from subcellular to organism scales. An education in Biomedical Engineering, and engineering more broadly, enables students to translate abstract hypothesis and scientific knowledge into working systems (e.g., prosthetic devices, imaging systems, and biopharmaceuticals). This enables one to both test the understanding of basic principles and to further this knowledge, and it places this understanding in the broader context of societal needs. "
Computer Science,https://handbook.fas.harvard.edu/book/computer-science,"The concentration in Computer Science is designed to teach students skills they will use immediately and ideas they will exploit in the future in ways unimaginable today. Because information technology affects every aspect of society, graduates with computer science degrees have open to them an enormous variety of careers—engineering, teaching, medicine, law, basic science, entertainment, management, and countless others. "
Electrical Engineering,https://handbook.fas.harvard.edu/book/electrical-engineering,"Electrical Engineering is a broadly diverse field that encompasses, for example, controls, communications, signal processing, circuit design, computer engineering, and electronic and photonic devices.

It also requires completion of a minimum of three electrical engineering electives and two additional engineering electives. "
Engineering Sciences,https://handbook.fas.harvard.edu/book/engineering-sciences,"Harvard offers two degrees in Engineering Sciences: the Bachelor of Arts (AB) and the Bachelor of Science (SB). The degree requirements differ for each of these programs: the AB program requires between 14 and 16 courses (56-64 credits) and the SB program requires 20 courses (80 credits). Students in the Engineering Sciences AB program specialize in one of four engineering tracks: biomedical sciences and engineering, electrical and computer engineering, engineering physics, or mechanical and materials science and engineering. Students interested in an AB degree may also consider the Biomedical Engineering concentration and the Environmental Science and Engineering concentration, which are also listed in this publication. Students pursuing the SB degree in the Engineering Sciences concentration typically specialize in one of two tracks: bioengineering or environmental science and engineering. Students interested in an SB degree specializing in Electrical Engineering or Mechanical Engineering should refer directly to those concentrations, which are also listed in this publication. Students may also apply to a cross-disciplinary track within the Engineering Sciences SB program, which provides the opportunity to learn between or across traditional engineering areas. "
Environmental Science and Engineering,https://handbook.fas.harvard.edu/book/environmental-science-and-engineering,"Environmental Science and Engineering (ESE) is an interdisciplinary program with the goal of understanding, predicting, and responding to natural and human-induced environmental change. Addressing environmental issues such as global warming, stratospheric ozone depletion, or local and regional air and water pollution requires perspectives from a diverse set of scientific disciplines including atmospheric physics and chemistry, oceanography, glaciology, hydrology, geophysics, ecology, and biogeochemistry. This program is structured around the view that the environmental system is comprised of a complex set of chemical, physical, and biological interactions, made even more complicated by the various activities of human society. Through exploration of the underlying processes and feedbacks within the Earth system, and with a range of approaches from theory and modeling to experiments and observations, students are trained to think about environmental processes in an integrated fashion, preparing them to manage the environmental challenges we face."
Mechanical Engineering,https://handbook.fas.harvard.edu/book/mechanical-engineering,"The concentration in Mechanical Engineering is structured for a diversity of educational and professional objectives. For students who are planning to work as practicing engineers or who may be preparing for careers in business, education, government, or law—and for those whose career objectives may be less specific—the concentration provides an ideal framework for a well-rounded technical and scientific education. "
Astrophysics,https://handbook.fas.harvard.edu/book/astrophysics,"The concentration in Astrophysics introduces students to a broad range of phenomena through a program of both observational and theoretical courses. This program builds from a foundation of modern physics to a general account of the known contents of the universe. Astronomy 16 and 17 provide a complete introductory survey to the major fields of astrophysics. The research tutorial, Astronomy 98, places students in close contact with the wide range of research activities at the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics. Undergraduates are strongly encouraged to pursue research projects (conducted under the mentorship of members of the faculty), which culminate in their junior papers and optional senior theses. Since the emphasis of astrophysics is on the explanation of phenomena in the universe in terms of physical theory, the initial stages of a concentration in Astrophysics closely resemble those of the Physics concentration, and the courses offered by the Department of Astronomy are readily accessible to any student with a good physics background. Our concentration offers avenues similar to Physics for future employment and research opportunities. "
Chemical and Physical Biology,https://handbook.fas.harvard.edu/book/chemical-and-physical-biology,"The Chemical and Physical Biology (CPB) concentration provides students with a broad foundation in the physical and life sciences. This concentration is designed for students interested in applying quantitative tools, physical concepts, and chemical principles to the study of biology. "
Chemistry,https://handbook.fas.harvard.edu/book/chemistry,"Chemistry is the science of the structure, properties, and reactions of matter. It is both a basic science, fundamental to an understanding of the world we live in, and a practical science with an enormous number and variety of important applications. Knowledge of chemistry is fundamental to an understanding of biology and biochemistry and of certain aspects of geology, astronomy, physics, and engineering."
Chemistry and Physics,https://handbook.fas.harvard.edu/book/chemistry-and-physics,"The requirements of the Chemistry and Physics concentration are designed to provide a solid foundation for further study in either or both of these two closely related sciences. Concentrators have gone on to graduate work and careers in chemistry, physics, and other quantitative fields. The concentration is also often chosen by students whose career goals lie in medicine.

"
Environmental Science and Public Policy,https://handbook.fas.harvard.edu/book/environmental-science-and-public-policy,"The concentration in Environmental Science and Public Policy (ESPP) is designed to provide a multidisciplinary introduction to current problems of the environment. It is founded on the premise that the ability to form rational judgments concerning many of the complex challenges confronting society today involving the environment requires both an understanding of the underlying scientific and technical issues and an appreciation for the relevant economic, political, legal, historical, and ethical dimensions. All students have to satisfy a core of requirements in the physical, biological, and social sciences and mathematics. Depending on preparation, students may be encouraged to substitute more advanced courses for these requirements. In consultation with their concentration adviser, students also develop an individual plan of study for a series of advanced courses around a particular field of specialization. Through their field of specialization, students develop expertise in a particular field of study relating to the environment."
Human Developmental and Regenerative Biology,https://handbook.fas.harvard.edu/book/human-developmental-and-regenerative-biology,"Human Developmental and Regenerative Biology (HDRB) is a life science concentration that educates students on how human beings develop from a fertilized egg, are maintained and repaired throughout adulthood, and age till life’s end. Students will be given a broad education in modern life sciences by studying important biological principles within the specific rubric of the developing and regenerating body. By adding an explicit and heavy emphasis on hands-on research opportunities in all four undergraduate years, HDRB will engage students with an interest in research and take advantage of Harvard’s special strengths as a teaching college and research university. "
Human Evolutionary Biology,https://handbook.fas.harvard.edu/book/human-evolutionary-biology,"All HEB concentrators receive a core introduction to basic evolutionary biology as well as human and nonhuman primate genetics, physiology, anatomy, behavioral biology, and paleontology. HEB courses also explore interactions between genes and environments, and the co-evolution of biology and culture. "
Integrative Biology,https://handbook.fas.harvard.edu/book/integrative-biology,"IB asks questions about the function, evolution, and interaction of organisms, both now and in the past. What kinds of organisms are there and how are they related? How is an organism's functional design and behavior related to its environment? What are the genetic and morphological mechanisms underlying an organism's development, and how is evolution influenced by development? Integrative biology can be approached in many ways, reflecting an interest in a specific group of organisms (e.g., plants, animals, microorganisms), in level of organization (e.g., ecological systems, population genetics), in approach (e.g., systematics, biogeography, biomechanics, developmental biology, mathematical theory, neurobiology), or in sampling broadly across multiple areas. IB is, therefore, inherently an interdisciplinary field, ranging over different levels of biological organization, evolutionary processes, taxa, and physiological and molecular systems. Courses emphasize student learning, critical thinking, and may include participation in research and field experiences, with the goal of fostering a foundation of knowledge and appetite for life-long learning, as students prepare for careers in the life sciences and related fields and professions. "
Mathematics,https://handbook.fas.harvard.edu/book/mathematics,"Mathematics is the science of order, and mathematicians seek to identify instances of order and to formulate and understand concepts that enable us to perceive order in complicated situations. "
Molecular and Cellular Biology,https://handbook.fas.harvard.edu/book/molecular-and-cellular-biology,"The Molecular and Cellular Biology concentration emphasizes the intersection of modern research in cellular biology with medicine and society. It is rooted in the investigation of biological processes based on the study of molecules and their interactions in the context of cells and tissues, and in understanding how the vast information context of the genome orchestrates the behavior of the cell. MCB is therefore ideally suited for students who wish to study molecular and cellular processes at the heart of both normal physiology and disease. It focuses on fundamental principles of modern biology at the hub of nearly all life science sub-disciplines, and integrates many different methodologies ranging from chemistry and genetics to computer science and engineering, as well as fundamental concepts in physics and mathematics. "
Neuroscience,https://handbook.fas.harvard.edu/book/neuroscience,"Neuroscience, the study of the nervous system, is a field that investigates the biological mechanisms that underlie behavior and how brains process information. To develop a comprehensive understanding, we study the nervous system at every level: from the macroscopic (behavior and cognition) to the microscopic (cells and molecules). Consequently, the questions that neuroscientists ask are wide-ranging. For example, how do electrical, chemical, and molecular signals allow neurons to process and transmit information from the environment? What guides the development of the immense number of precise connections in the nervous system? How can the complex signals of many thousands of active neurons be recorded, interpreted, and modeled? What causes the profound behavioral deficits in Alzheimer’s disease or Autism Spectrum Disorder? "
Physics,https://handbook.fas.harvard.edu/book/physics,"The concentration in Physics, administered by the Department of Physics, serves a variety of goals and interests. Many concentrators seek an understanding of the subtle, profound, and fundamental laws—relativity, quantum mechanics, and the basic force laws—that govern the behavior of all matter. Often these studies involve the smallest units of matter: molecules, atoms, nuclei, and sub-nuclear particles. A major interest of other Physics concentrators is the exploration and explanation of the diverse properties to which these laws give rise in macroscopic systems such as fluids and solids. Still others study aspects of more complex systems like oceans and atmospheres, stars, and living matter. "
Psychology,https://handbook.fas.harvard.edu/book/psychology,"Psychology is the scientific study of the mind, and as such, we investigate the minds of humans and other species. We try to understand the mind at many different levels of analysis, from taking measurements from the brain, through learning about the individual, all the way to understanding groups and organizations. The kinds of questions psychologists attempt to answer are: How do we perceive the physical world? Does our view of it coincide with reality? How do we make sense of the social world? Can we really understand the minds of others? Which others, and do the groups “they” belong to matter? Why do we pay attention to some things and not others? How do memories form and how do we forget? Can we be said to have a memory even if we can’t “remember”? What are the rules by which we reason and think? What’s the role of emotion as expressed in the joy, surprise, sadness, anger and fear of everyday life as well as in depression, schizophrenia, and other disorders? What are the causes of these kinds of disorders, and how can they be treated? Are we rational beings or only boundedly so? Why do we believe in religion, do we have unshakable feelings of morality, and how best should we study our own consciousness? How do all these processes develop from infancy to adulthood? To answer these and other questions about the mind, psychologists pay attention to evolutionary factors, biological bases, cultural and social inputs, as well as the day-to-day situations in which individuals find themselves. Most of the research conducted in Harvard’s Department of Psychology concerns basic psychological processes such as attention, perception, memory, categorization, reasoning, decision-making, language, cognitive and social development, social cognition, intergroup relations, and morality. In addition, some members of the department conduct research on the etiology, development, and treatment of psychopathology. All members of the department share the common goal of understanding mind, brain, and behavior through empirical investigation, and their teaching and research reflect this goal. "
Statistics,https://handbook.fas.harvard.edu/book/statistics,"Statistics is a relatively young discipline, organized around the rapidly growing body of knowledge about principled methods for data collection and data analysis, the making of rational decisions under uncertainty, and the modeling of randomness in any quantitative inquiries, including the social, natural, and medical sciences. Statistics has a theoretical core surrounded by a large number of domains of application in fields such as anthropology, astronomy, biology, business, chemistry, computer science, economics, education, engineering, environmental sciences, epidemiology, finance, forensic science, geophysical sciences, government, history, law, linguistics, mathematics, medicine, physics, population science, psychology, sociology, and many others. A basic goal of the concentration in Statistics is to help students acquire the conceptual, computational, and mathematical tools for quantifying uncertainty and making sense of complex data arising from many applications - including statistically sound ways of collecting such data. The mathematical preparation required includes multivariable calculus and linear algebra. The computational preparation required includes Computer Science 50, or above. "
"Art, Film, and Visual Studies",https://handbook.fas.harvard.edu/book/art-film-and-visual-studies,"The concentration in Art, Film, and Visual Studies (AFVS) cultivates skills in both the practice and the critical study of the visual arts. Its components include photography, filmmaking, animation, video art, painting, drawing, printmaking and sculpture, as well as film and visual studies, critical theory, and the study of the built environment. The department has a strong commitment to fostering dialogue among makers, critics, and theorists. The modes of teaching combine the intensity of conservatory programs with the broad intellectual aims of a liberal arts college. "
Classics,https://handbook.fas.harvard.edu/book/classics,"Classics as an intellectual discipline embraces the study of ancient Greece and Rome, two civilizations whose legacy has played a major role in shaping our modern world. The Greeks and Romans produced literature and philosophy of enduring power and impact; they created art and architecture of unsurpassed grace and beauty; they made discoveries in science and math that anticipate principles and theorems re-discovered in the Renaissance; they grappled with problems of economics and governance that still challenge us today. In short, the Greco-Roman world provides the modern student with a laboratory of the human condition. Hence, the Department of the Classics encourages its students to explore the whole range of Greco-Roman civilization from the Bronze Age through Byzantium and medieval Europe to Modern Greece. "
Comparative Literature,https://handbook.fas.harvard.edu/book/comparative-literature,"The undergraduate program in Comparative Literature prepares students to play an active and creative role in today’s globalized world by exploring literature and culture across languages and national borders. Working in more than one language, our students investigate the inter-connections among literatures, cultures, and media to explore the human experience in a comparative and interdisciplinary context. "
East Asian Studies,https://handbook.fas.harvard.edu/book/east-asian-studies,"The concentration in East Asian Studies seeks to develop a critical understanding of the human experience in East Asia. To study East Asia is to be exposed to a world with different forms of political activity and social relations, religious traditions of great depth and philosophical schools with enduring insights, and literatures of unusual range and power. It is also to study a world that since the 19th century has come to share in the dilemmas of modernity that we all confront. For some this inquiry provides a challenging and satisfying addition to a liberal arts education. For some it is an opportunity to restore connections to an ancestral past. For others it leads to graduate studies. And for many others it is the beginning of a professional career with an East Asian component. The program provides preparation for a variety of fields of work and advanced study after graduation. Study abroad is encouraged. "
English,https://english.fas.harvard.edu/guide-concentrators,"Humans make meaning: we can’t help ourselves. We tell stories; we arrange patterns in words, and those patterns affect everything we do. They represent us to ourselves and others, and they change the world. English concentrators study—and create—art made out of words: fiction and nonfiction, tragedy, comedy, lyric, and much more. By studying English literature, you will learn to interpret the verbal expression of others and to make the meanings you want for yourself—skills more crucial than ever in a digital age, when so many words travel so fast. You’ll also visit the dazzling imaginary worlds that have brought readers and writers together across vast expanses of space and time. As you encounter many cultures and many lives in poems, novels, screenplays, playscripts, comics, and hip hop rhymes, you will discover new ways of living in and bettering our interconnected communities."
Folklore and Mythology,https://handbook.fas.harvard.edu/book/folklore-and-mythology,"Folklore and Mythology is a liberal education in and of itself. The program encourages the study of any given society through its language and culture, offering an array of choices for drawing on a variety of disciplines in the humanities and social sciences. To focus on the folklore and mythology of a society (at local, regional as well as national levels) is to understand how that group or society defines itself through epics, music, folktales, legends, dramas, dance, rituals, “beliefs,” proverbs, customs, law codes, festival celebrations, “wisdom literature,” and many other forms of expressive culture. To study the folklore and mythology of any group is to discover how that group identifies itself in relation to others. Concentrators conduct independent research on the material, oral, written, or performed forms of folklore and mythology in a variety of cultures, among them African, North and South American, Celtic, Chinese, English, German, Greek, Indian, Japanese, Scandinavian, and Slavic. "
Germanic Languages and Literatures,https://handbook.fas.harvard.edu/book/germanic-languages-and-literatures,"The Department of Germanic Languages and Literatures offers a rich and diverse program of literary and cultural studies, including film and music. We offer students the option to pursue a concentration in German Studies, Scandinavian Studies, or a joint concentration in German and another field. Our goal is to provide students with the enriching experience of studying languages, literatures, and cultures different from their own so they can gain new perspectives on their languages and countries of origin. At the same time, students will learn how the German-speaking and Nordic countries have influenced the development of Western culture and society. Our graduates are well positioned to understand the central role played by modern Germany in international politics and economics. They can explain why Germany takes the positions it does, the role of the European Union, and why international organizations call on distinguished members of the Scandinavian countries to represent them on taskforces involving matters of conscience. We aim above all to equip students with proficient language, analytical and critical skills for academic, professional, or personal use, as well as an understanding of the politics, culture, history, and ideas through literature, film, music, and other media. Thus, the program is designed not only for students who wish to pursue graduate study in Germanic studies, but also for students who choose careers in education, medicine, law, government, the social sciences, scientific research, business, the arts, design, and other fields. "
History and Literature,https://handbook.fas.harvard.edu/book/history-and-literature,"History and Literature is the oldest concentration at Harvard. At the heart of History and Literature are individual and small group tutorials which provide individual instruction, opportunities to pursue specific topics in depth, and dedicated mentoring. Along with the core History and Literature tutorials, concentrators take concentration courses across a variety of departments and programs: Romance Languages and Literatures; African and African American Studies; Art, Film, and Visual Studies; History of Art and Architecture; Theater, Dance and Media; Music; Women, Gender, and Sexuality; as well as History, English, and many more. "
History of Art and Architecture,https://handbook.fas.harvard.edu/book/history-art-and-architecture,"The History of Art & Architecture concentration offers training in the historical interpretation and critical analysis of the visual arts and architecture. It develops the skills of visual discrimination and verbal expression fundamental to art historical analysis. Art history is a multifaceted discipline embracing many different methods, perspectives and interests. Training in the critical analysis of art seeks to clarify the perception – and understanding – of how artworks relate to the techniques and materials used in their making, and to the environment in which they are seen. It also fosters the ability to make and explain judgments of quality and value."
Linguistics,https://linguistics.fas.harvard.edu/pages/requirements-concentrators,"Linguists are engaged in the study of language structure, which is the ultimate interdisciplinary enterprise. Linguistic theory attempts to model a complex domain of human knowledge that is also central to philosophy of mind and to cognitive psychology. The linguistic models that theoretical linguists construct are formal in character and rely on computational and mathematical methodologies. As such, linguistics has a mutually beneficial relationship with computer science and the study of artificial intelligence."
Music,https://handbook.fas.harvard.edu/book/music,"The concentration in Music exposes students to a wide variety of musical styles, sounds, and musical traditions in order to develop their critical understanding of music in diverse cultural and historical contexts. The concentration also provides a solid foundation in theory, analysis, composition, and criticism, while developing critical listening skills, which are a pivotal contribution that engagement with music makes to the humanities. Although the Department of Music is not in itself a school of music with a performance department, all of our courses support the intellectual development of musicians, and several of our courses incorporate or focus on performance."
Near Eastern Languages and Civilizations,https://handbook.fas.harvard.edu/book/near-eastern-languages-and-civilizations,"The Department of Near Eastern Languages and Civilizations introduces students to the ancient and modern peoples, languages, cultures, and societies of the Near/Middle East. Loosely defined as stretching from Morocco in the west to Iran and Afghanistan in the east, the region is home some of the world’s great religions and civilizations. Historically, the influence of its languages, literatures and cultures has extended to Central, East and Southeast Asia, sub-Saharan Africa, Europe and North America. Thus, the study of the Near and Middle East is an important area of academic inquiry on account of its political, economic and cultural significance on the international stage."
Philosophy,https://handbook.fas.harvard.edu/book/philosophy,"Philosophy studies many of humanity’s fundamental questions: how should we live, what kind of society should we strive towards, what are the limits of human knowledge? What is truth? Justice? Beauty? These questions are central to our lives, because in much of what we do, we at least implicitly assume answers to them. Philosophy seeks to reflect on these questions and answer them in a systematic, explicit, and rigorous way—relying on careful argumentation, and drawing from outside fields as diverse as economics, literature, religion, law, mathematics, the physical sciences, and psychology. And while most of the tradition of philosophy is Western, we seek to connect with non-Western traditions like Islam and Buddhism, as well."
"Religion, Comparative Study of",https://handbook.fas.harvard.edu/book/religion-comparative-study,"The concentration in the Comparative Study of Religion invites students to explore the most consequential and momentous questions relevant to the understanding of individual and communal human life. Concentrators consider topics such as the significance of ritual and practice; differing conceptions of human nature and the nature of the divine; and comparative study of how people understand the meaning of life, suffering, and death. Our program is unique in allowing students to take up these and other “big” questions in rigorous and critical ways."
Romance Languages and Literatures,https://handbook.fas.harvard.edu/book/romance-languages-and-literatures,"In the Department of Romance Languages and Literatures (RLL), undergraduates discover the literatures, cultures, and critical approaches of societies worldwide where French, Italian, Portuguese, Spanish, and Catalan are spoken. RLL offers language courses from the beginning to advanced levels, as well as opportunities for accelerated work and study abroad.

These countries share a rich cultural life as well as a turbulent and fascinating history. In the Slavic concentration, you will develop proficiency in Russian or another Slavic language such as Czech, Polish, or Ukrainian; you will learn to read literary works in the original language, gain valuable experience for working and traveling abroad, and come to understand these cultures and the important role they have played in the modern world."
South Asian Studies,https://handbook.fas.harvard.edu/book/south-asian-studies,"A concentration in South Asian Studies enables students to develop a critical understanding of the diverse cultures, histories, languages and literatures of South Asia, which includes Bangladesh, India, Nepal, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, and Tibet. South Asia is home to more than a billion people and some of the world’s most fascinating and important civilizations. Its influence has extended historically from Central, East, and Southeast Asia to Europe and North America, which today have vibrant South Asian diasporas. The study of South Asia is an increasingly important area of academic inquiry, especially in recent decades as the region emerges as a global cultural, economic, and political power."
"Theater, Dance & Media",https://tdm.fas.harvard.edu/basic-concentration,"Theater, Dance & Media (TDM) combines historical and theoretical study of live and digital arts with the practice of those arts. Taught by FAS Faculty, and by practitioners from the American Repertory Theater (A.R.T.) and the Dance Center, as well as numerous visiting artists/scholars each year, students are introduced to the rigor and discipline required to participate in professional theater, dance and media practices. TDM emphasizes collaboration. The concentration explores the many ways to act, design, direct, compose, produce, choreograph, dance, write, produce and organize models of live art production. Our studio courses model and study the many forms that collaboration can take; similarly, scholarly courses look to the history and theory of culture in order to complement the skills gained in studio practice."
African and African American Studies,https://handbook.fas.harvard.edu/book/african-and-african-american-studies,"The Department of African and African American Studies brings together scholars and scholarship from many disciplines to explore the histories, societies, and cultures of African and African-descended people. The field of African and African American Studies is not only interdisciplinary but also comparative and cross-cultural."
Anthropology,https://handbook.fas.harvard.edu/book/anthropology,Anthropology is the study of human diversity in the distant past and the present and teaches us to recognize the remarkable array of circumstances in which human beings live their lives and make meaning from them.
East Asian Studies,https://handbook.fas.harvard.edu/book/east-asian-studies,"The concentration in East Asian Studies seeks to develop a critical understanding of the human experience in East Asia.

Economics,https://handbook.fas.harvard.edu/book/economics,"Economics is a social science that covers broad subject matter in seeking to understand the social world. An economic analysis begins from the premise that individuals have goals and that they pursue those goals as best they can. Economics studies the behavior of social systems—such as markets, corporations, legislatures, and families—as the outcome of interactions through institutions between goal-directed individuals. Ultimately, economists make recommendations that they believe will make people better off."
Government,https://handbook.fas.harvard.edu/book/government,"The Department of Government—like political science—is an umbrella for a remarkable range of political subjects and approaches to studying them. It stands at the cross-roads of history, law, economics, sociology, philosophy, and ethics, borrowing from these disciplines as well as constructing theories and methods of its own."
History,https://history.fas.harvard.edu/concentration-requirements,"History is a broad discipline encompassing every dimension of human interaction in the past, including social life, the economy, culture, thought, and politics. Students of history study individuals, groups, communities, and nations from every imaginable perspective—employing all the techniques of the humanities and social sciences to raise questions and probe for answers. Students explore the origins and developments that have shaped our contemporary world; and take courses that span the globe and range in chronological scope from antiquity to today."
History and Science,https://handbook.fas.harvard.edu/book/history-and-sciences,"History & Science is an interdisciplinary field of study. The program offers students a variety of opportunities to expand their understanding of the scientific enterprise and to explore in detail how science has developed in history and how science has shaped other human activities. Students are challenged to ask big questions about science, medicine, and technology, and their place in human societies across time. How do scientists come to know things about the natural world? Why should we believe what they tell us? What are some social, ethical, political and religious implications of science? How do they affect the way people in different times and places live their lives?"
Psychology,https://handbook.fas.harvard.edu/book/psychology,"Psychology is the scientific study of the mind, and as such, we investigate the minds of humans and other species.
